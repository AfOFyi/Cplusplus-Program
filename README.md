# Cplusplus-Program
Repository for a project developed during SNHU CS-210-18817-M01

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was intended to provide a scenario company with a solution that provides users with how many items were provided within an input text file. 
  The solution was to have 3 options: allow the user to enter a search term (intended to be an item within the provided list) and get back how many instances of that item were in the input; allow the user to view a full list of all items with a number representing how many times that item was in the list; allow the user to view a histogram (similar to the previous option but with a special character repeated multiple times representing how many instances of that item was in the list). 
  There was also to be an option to exit the program. 
What did you do particularly well?
	I believe my solution for reading from the input list file into a vector of custom class was clever and implemented well. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	I could break up my mainMenu into smaller functions to reduce indentation. That would make my code more maintenance-friendly.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	There were several parts of this project that I found challenging and reached out for support through the SNHU Tutor support suite. But I think the most challening part was reading from file input, reading through a vector to find a match, if there was a match increasing the frequency count, and if there was no item match to create a new item and append it to the vector.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	The ability to write clean, thorough documentation is very transferable to other projects, whether related to coding or not.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this program maintanable by breaking up elements into separate functions, though there is still room for improvement.
  I made this program readable by using consistent naming conventions, using appropriate whitespace adjustments, and using inline comments throughout.
  I made this program adaptable by using modular functions.
